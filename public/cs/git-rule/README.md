- There's a CODEOWNERS file in the project.

- This codeowners file above means every file needs to have the approval of the user @jfgomes. Otherwise the code is never pushed to master.

## Git rules notes:

- The master branch is blocked for pushes. Nobody can push directly to it.


- Push to master is only allowed after approved PR's.


- Every developer needs to create a new branch to change the code and create a PR after to master.


- New branches can have the following prefixes: Feature/xxxxx Bugfix/xxxxx Fix/xxxxx Enhancement/xxxxx.


- ThereÂ´s a codeowners file on the project where GitHub will read after the PR created and will ask for approve of the users configured inside that.


- After the PR approved and the push to master is done, the web-hook to Jenkins will trigger the CI / CD to start.


- If the deploy is done successfully, delete the new branch.


- Update the Master branch before create another new branch.


- Iterate..
